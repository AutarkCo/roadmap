# Autark Flock Proposal: Nice to Haves
Please refer to our [Flock proposal](https://github.com/AutarkCo/flock/blob/master/teams/Autark/2019Q1-2.md) to see our proposed roadmap for Q1/Q2 of 2019. If we end up having additional capacity we will tackle these “Nice to Haves”. We will create surveys where [Aragon Cooperative](https://forum.aragon.org/t/community-initiative-aragon-cooperative/356) members can participate to help prioritize.

## Internationalization
### aragonAPI
To provide internationalization of Aragon apps, enhancements to aragonAPI will also be necessary, and we will begin to implement changes for multi-language support, such as front-ends for right-to-left languages and creating a strings repository where translations can be managed by the community. This will also tie in to our Data initiative.
## Cross-Application User Experience
### Expanded Forwarder Options
Depending on the viability of this research and potential use cases, this would require adding information into the App Center flow so different classes of forwarders can be identified and installed as needed within organizations. 

We would also focus on supplementing the development of the App Center to allow for installation flows that are more accommodating to the increased complexity of potential app dependencies. This will be necessary once there is no longer a strongly defined 1-to-1 relationship between an app frontend and contract. This includes research into the idea of application suites through tightly coupled re-works of pre-existing applications geared towards specific use cases.
## Contextual Discussions
- Deliver a user-friendly way to enable/disable discussion modules within apps during the App Center setup.
- Displaying the edit history for comments
## Rich User Profiles
- Display collectibles or other ERC-721 badges that the user owns
- Ability to upload publications, conference papers or presentations
- Ability to upload a cover photo
## Expanding Governance Possibilities
Create DAO templates that support traditional shareholder corporations, cooperatives. Deliver additional templates based on demand from user surveys.

## Enhanced Collaboration
### Projects App
We will begin creating an iteration of the Projects app that is decoupled from Github. We have to talk to the Pando team further to see how our roadmaps can converge, and also have an understanding from the community with their comfort level of adopting pando as a vcs vs. git. 

Additional features that will be nice for the projects app will be:
- KanBan pipelines and advanced task management
- Projects having account addresses and budgets
- Private project support
- Gantt charts
### Consensus App
Allow for special voting sessions to be created, where the aim is to reach consensus among the voting session participants.
The Consensus app ended up being scoped out of our Nest grant for the Planning Suite. We still think it is important and we will keep it on our roadmap. 
## DAO Identity
- About app lists active team members, roadmap
- Take on clients who want assistance with creating custom branded implementations.
